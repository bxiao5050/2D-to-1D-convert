# XRD frames converter
## Overview
When using a two-dimensional detector, Bruker D8 Discover gives a two-dimensional "GADDS Frame" that shows intensity 
as a function of 2theta and chi. By default, the Bruker software can only deal with one frame each time. This tool allows users
to display and convert diffraction data into supported format, and download the result into user-selected file formats.
Select “folder paths” to choose the files/folders for conversion, and select “start” to test the functionality.
